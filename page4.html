                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">The temple of Pek Ee Tong was set up in 1952 by Venerable Xian Lin who passed away in 1960 and was succeeded by Venerable Zong Jing until her passing in 2012.&nbsp; The temple was then passed to Kek Lok Si and was left vacant for few years in search for a suitable candidate to carry on the legacy of Pek Ee Tong. Under predestined fate,&nbsp; Pek Ee Tong was handed over to Venerable Kai Xun as the first Abbot Monk on 12 November 2017&nbsp; by Senior Monk Venerable Ri Heng,&nbsp; the Abbot Monk of Kek Lok Si.<br>
<br>Since being promoted as the Abbot of Pek Ee Tong, Venerable Kai Xun played a very important role in promoting Buddhism to serve the residents of Jelutong by holding regular prayers and chanting of sutras&nbsp; which include 《Lotus Sutra》，《Shurangama Sutra》，《Ten Wheel Sutra of Ksitigarbha》 and 《Emperor Liang Repentance》 etc.&nbsp;<br><br>Dharma class was also held on every Saturday where Venerable Fa Yao was invited to teach&nbsp; to explain the Dharma of sutras which include 《Ten Wheel Sutra of Ksitigarbha》，《Vajra Prajna Paramita Sutra》，《Emperor Liang Repentance》etc. in hope that more Buddha followers&nbsp; can listen to Dharma talk and&nbsp; to understand in order to practice so that more true believer can be cultivated.<br>
<br>Beside promoting Buddhism, Venerable Kai Xun also upgraded the appearance of Pek Ee Tong such as planting of flowers and plants to beautify the compound&nbsp; and at the same time to give a touch of greenery to the surrounding of the temple.&nbsp; The original wire fencing was converted into concrete fence with the renovation work which started on 19 September 2019 with the scriptures of&nbsp;Thousand Hands Avalokitesvara surrounded with White Robe Avolakitesvara images imprinted in tiles. The project was completed 20 March 2020 resulting in Pek Ee Tong looking more solemn.<br></p>

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4"><strong>Founder of Pek Ee Tong —— Venerable Xian Lin</strong><br>Venerable Xian Lin received ordination at Kek Lok Si in 1948. She had very strong faith in Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva&nbsp; so she vowed to convert the purchased land into a temple to worship Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva. After facing several difficulties of land purchase procedures&nbsp; and after successfully completed the construction project of&nbsp; Pek Ee Tong, her health began to deteriorate and she passed away on April 25, 1960 and she was succeeded by her daughter Venerable Zong Jing&nbsp;<br>
<br><strong>Head of Pek Ee Tong since (1961-2012)—— Venerable Zong Jing</strong><br>Venerable Zong Jing was the eldest daughter of Venerable Xian Lin before she became a monk. She received the ordination at Kek Lok Si Temple in 1948 along with her mother Venerable Xian Lin. In 1961, she succeeded her mother to manage Pek Ee Tong until her passing on April 8, 2012, at the age of 87.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Current Abbot Monk of Pek Ee Tong —— Venerable Kai Xun</strong><br>- Venerable Kai Xun was born in Kedah, Malaysia in 1986.<br>- In 2009, he was ordained as a monk under the seat of the&nbsp;Senior Wen Jian who is the abbot monk of Hong Hock See Temple and he was given the name " Kai Xun".<br>- In 2011, he received full ordination at Yuan Tong Temple in Puli, Taiwan.<br>- Graduated from Malaysia Buddhist Institute&nbsp; in 2016. In the same year, senior monk Venerable Ri Heng passed on the Dharma to Venerable Kai Xun, and he was the fiftieth generation of Cao Dong’s authentic Dharma heirs. His Dharma name is 'Jin Yuan'.<br>- In 2017, he was selected to be the first Abbot of Pek Ee Tong and had since held the post to present.<br></p>

From the above photo, it was found that the attendees included: Elder Zhi Kun, the abbot monk of Kek Lok Si Temple at that time, Elder Zhen Guo, Elder Qing Yuan, and Elder Ming De.<br><br>In 1947, Venerable Xian Lin bought the building and converted it into a self-study place. After Venerable Xian Lin obtained the land deed, she held the opening ceremony of the inauguration of the Pek Ee Tong on the 14th day of the eighth lunar month of the lunar calendar. Although Venerable Xian Lin and Venerable Zong Jing at that time were upholding the precepts of Bhikkhuni precepts, there was no restriction on shaving their heads, so they tied their hair in buns. Until they pass away, bhikkhunis will shave their heads to present the ordination image as nun. This is a unique phenomenon of Chinese Buddhism in the early Nan Yang, and these people are called "A Gu".<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>

The process of shaping the statues was faced with many difficulties&nbsp; and after a long&nbsp; search in&nbsp; several places, finally a sculptor&nbsp; was found at the foot of the Kek Lok Si Temple mountain. However, he was old and refused Venerable Xian Lin's request.&nbsp; But after continuous persuasion he finally agreed.&nbsp; Before the start&nbsp; of the craftwork, prayer and incense was offered&nbsp; hoping that the image of the&nbsp; &nbsp;Bodhisattva he created would meet Venerable Xian Lin's request. The bodhisattva that the sculptor created was exactly the same as the image in Venerable Xian Lin's dream.&nbsp;<br></p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>1. </strong>On the 26th day of the first lunar month, on the opening day of the Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva, red envelopes are placed in front of the bodhisattva altar in the hall. The believers will toss a pair of&nbsp; moon block divination&nbsp; in front of the Bodhisattva, seeking permmision to borrow red envelopes in hope for a more prosperous year ahead with the promise&nbsp; to repay&nbsp; back the next year.&nbsp; This event became popular as the&nbsp; borrowed red envelopes were said to bless wealth.<br><br><strong>2. Devotees&nbsp;</strong>ask for signed poems. The signed poems are divided into two categories: First. There are 60 poems for ordinary questions. The content of the signed poems is the same as that of Guang Fu Palace and Burma Road Guanyin Temple. Second, there are 60 medicine swabs in total. In the age of underdeveloped medicine, medicine swabs have become one of the choices for auxiliary medical care. The poems signed by Pek Ee Tong are said to be&nbsp; most effective. Many believers who have problems will ask for the poems signed by the Guan Yin in white, hoping to solve the current predicament.<br><br><strong>3.</strong> On the deed, the parents will bring the newborn baby to Pek Ee Tong and to pray in front of the Guanyin Bodhisattva, and hope the Bodhisattva will bless the baby to&nbsp; grow into an successful adult .<br><br><strong>4.</strong> The seven-star lamp is mainly used to pray for peace and health.<br><br><strong>5.</strong>&nbsp;"Ong Seng Chi" were sold after the nun recited the&nbsp; rebirth mantras and&nbsp; incense sticks were used to poke holes on the rebirth money.&nbsp; It is said&nbsp; that the rebirth money recited by&nbsp; Pek Ee Tong is the most effective and popular.<br><br><strong>6. </strong>Free vegetarian meal were served on the first and fifteenth day of every month of the lunar calender<br><br><strong>In addition to the first two&nbsp; traditions still popular, the method of the seven-star lamp has also been replaced by the form of Annual Lighting and the "Ong Seng Chi" have been abolished.</strong><br></p>
